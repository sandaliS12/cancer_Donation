            <b class="text-center">Why should request a visiting appointment</b>
            <p>If someone or a community
wants to organize an entertainment program for children ward or any other ward,
you want to meet the head of the ward and
request permission from that person. After getting his permission, then the requesting
person should write a letter and go to the director and give it to him and get his approval.
This will take more time and 
Sometimes you had to spend whole day for the hospital because, sometimes director is
in long meetings and so on. So, if you sent a request with your details we can handle it online and then you can save your time. 
            <br><br>
<b style="color:red;">Please consider the following when you request :</b>
            <br>
            <span style="color:red;">&#42;   &#42;  &#42; Please be kind enough to add your correct details and working contact numbers. Because, we have to contact you further.  &#42;   &#42;  &#42; </span>
